# Object Oriented Programming in Java-Specialization:
This repository contains all the codes that I written and studied through [Object Oriented Programming in Java Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming)

## Course 1: [Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming?specialization=object-oriented-programming)
This course contains the basics syntax of Java.

- Assignment 1: [perimeter quiz](https://github.com/karim19mohamed/Object-Oriented-Programming-in-Java-Specialization/tree/main/Course%201:%20Java%20Programming:%20Solving%20Problems%20with%20Software/Assignment%201:%20perimeter_quiz)

  The code calculate the perimeter of any shape. The shape is defined using a class that is defined in the library that is given by the course. It is meant not to write the code from scratch and use the library to train on the Abstraction concept.

  My task is to complete some methods of the code.
